# dictionaries allow you to connect simple pieces of related information
# in this lesson we will learn how to access information once its in a dictionary and how to modify that information

# consider a game featuring aliens that can have different colours and point values
# a dictionary stores that information about that alien

alien_0 = { "colour" : "green", "points" : 5 }

print(alien_0["colour"])
print(alien_0["points"])
