# an if statement is an expression that can be evaluated as True or False and is ...
# ... called a conditional test. if the if statement is True python executes the code ...
# ...following the if statement. if the test evaluates to false python ignores the following ...
# ... if statement

# most conditional test compare the current value to the variable to a specific ...
# value of interest. python uses the values True or False

x = 2 # the line sets the value x to equal 2
print("Does x equal 2?")
print(x == 2) # the line checks whether x is equal to 2 using the double equals sign (==)

print("\nDoes x equal 3?")
print(x == 3) # this check whether x is qual to 3
