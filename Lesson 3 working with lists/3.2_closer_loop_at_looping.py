# looping is important because it is one of the most common ways computers automate task
y = ["1", "2", "3"]
for x in y:
    # this line tells python to retrieve the first value from list y and store it in the variable x
    # the first value is 1. python reads the next line:
    print(x)
    # python retrieves the next item in the list which is 2
    # python print tje current value of magician again which is now 2
    # python repeats the entire loop once more  with the last value in the list which is 3
    # python moves to the next line which is nothing so the loop ends
